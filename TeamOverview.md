## Project Focus

The complete clinical picture of the virus SARS CoV-2 and the subsequent disease process of COVID-19 is not fully known.  Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity, with the duration and severity of each pandemic phase varying, based on the disease characteristics and possible virus mutations.

Currently what we have learned is that people with serious underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, and diabetes, are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness.

When considering the risk that COVID-19 poses to the world population, the CDC has recommended breaking down the risk into two types: risk of exposure and risk of serious illness and death.

Team Epic Nodes will focus on developing a blockchain application to manage massive amounts of healthcare data securely. This application will specifically address interoperability across multiple platforms of care coordination and patient outcomes.
